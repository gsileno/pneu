TODO
[monolithic animation] separate from monolithic analysis
[monolithic animation] consider the firing of multiple transitions with the same label
[monolithic analysis] complete it and refactor everything
[graphics] consider biflows connections
[graphics all] transform from static to normal class
[graphics PN2LaTeX] avoid to write labels on top of the arrows
[graphics PN2LaTeX] create automatically examples/out/tex directory
[graphics PN2Dot] create automatically examples/out/dot directory
[graphics PN2Dot] implement an absolute conversion
[graphics PN2SVG] todo

ERRORS
[graphics PN2LaTeX] convertrelative2 does not work perfectly, with actionscheme.pnml it lose one place and attach it to the transition
[actorbased animation] does not work
[monolithic animation] place-based executions do not work
[monolithic animation] after changing the semantics to one transition per step I have to reformulate many things
[monolithic animation] enabled-transition execution do not work

INFO
[graphics PN2LaTeX] convertrelative1 is not the best strategy, should be discarded
